# Greetings! Thanks for stopping by.
This is my manager README file. What is a manager README? Good question. Let's start there.

## What is this and why does it exist?
I created this document to help people on my team understand me better so that I can be a better manager for them. I also welcome anything that you feel comfortable sharing with me that might help us work better together. 
In addition, this document includes an outline of my expectations for me and managers who report into my organization. Please treat this document as a reference and promise on how I will conduct myself as a manager. I urge you to hold me accountable to my promises and to call out anything that might be missing from this document.

## What is my job?
My primary job is to do everything I can to help my team be successful and to make sure their successes are known appropriately throughout EG. This includes supporting and advocating for your success. It includes ensuring that our teams are working on the right things in the right order with the right information, as well as promoting and sharing their accomplishments. My job is to support this team and I expect this of every manager. 

## Guiding Principles for Leadership Important to Me
These are some things that are important to me in leadership. I’ve tried to credit the source of these principles to the best of my knowledge where possible. This is a living list that changes and grows over time as different things become more important to me and as I evolve as a person. 

* Our number one priority as managers is to do everything we can to help our teams be successful and make sure their successes are appropriately communicated throughout EG. See The Tactical for some ideas on how we do this.  
* Leaders don't have the luxury to be victims. We are activists, we are advocates, and we are proactive in making necessary changes. (Source: Aman Bhutani, former president of BEXG)
* To be a better leader, be a better person. (_Source: Aman Bhutani, former president of BEXG_)
* Continuous reflection, self-awareness, and evolution are key to improvement and being better. (_Source: general idea from Jon Holland, former VP of TLS_)
* Everything you're doing is preparing you, so pay attention and learn what you can from every scenario and every role you have. 
* Protect the castle. Whatever you are responsible for, own it and create excellence within your space.
* True listening is being open to change. (_Source: [Search Inside Yourself training](https://siyli.org/)_)
* Be careful when expecting others to assume positive intent. Do not put the onus of living with or correcting unacceptable behavior on the victim. On the other hand, please know that most people (like me) are not trying to be a jerk.
* Radical candor is best. Radical candor is not hurtful, it is honest with positive intent to help. (_Source: the book [“Radical Candor” by Kim Scott](https://www.radicalcandor.com/)_)
* Everyone is doing the best they can. This means that if someone isn’t performing in a way you think is appropriate, a conversation is the first step in figuring out what’s going on and figuring out next steps. 
* Every day is an invitation. (_Source: the book [“Love Does” by Bob Goff](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13497505-love-does)_)
* Let no opportunity be too small for your time and let no opportunity be too big for your possibilities. (_Source: Jon Stewart on [episode 6 of “Some Good News”](https://youtu.be/IweS2CPSnbI)_)
* Do the right thing, balancing our team members and the business, understanding business objectives and timing requirements alongside the right technical solutions.
* Don't reinvent the wheel. Good leaders steal good ideas (with integrity and giving credit where credit is due).
* Do everything with integrity.

## The Tactical
My job is to make sure you have what you need to do your job (see What is my job?). I am here to help you, so please let me know what you need to do your job better.

This list contains some of the more tactical things I expect from the leaders in my organization, including myself. When I was an IC, this list was different, though many of the ideas overlap. .

* We are coaching and growing our teams, helping them become great leaders and great contributors.
* We are creating and fostering a culture where people want to work. We are responsible for the psychological safety of our teams. (_Source: [NY Times article about Google’s quest to build the perfect team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) and [re: work with Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/)_)
* We are helping our team members be self-aware through direct and candid feedback.
* If a team member is not a good fit for our team or EG, we take action to let them find a place where they will be more likely to shine. 
* We know where the strong and weak spots are in our teams and we’re leading with them in mind.
* Team project work is appropriately prioritized.
* The team knows why their work is important. This means we know why our work is important. If you are unsure, I’m not doing my job, so please ask me!
* No one is surprised by the work the team is doing or why.
* We are communicating well with our colleagues (up, down and sideways) so that we have the support we need, recognizing that different people have different communication needs*.
* We’ve established relationships that help us and our teams move forward.
* We are having appropriate conversations to unblock the team.
* Our teams are delivering.
* The code quality that the team delivers is top notch.
* We know the status of all the projects our teams are working on and can answer basic questions.
* We are always looking forward and anticipating needs, risks, and capacity.
* We’re coming up with ideas to work better and more efficiently within TLS and beyond.
* We are constantly thinking one level above our teams – we’re thinking about TLS and/or LSTG.
* We always demonstrate One Team in actions and words. This means we are not simply operating in the silo of our responsibility, but with the greater TLS, LSTG, and EG org in mind and as a team member of this larger org.
* We own our impact and our teams’ impact to the organization; we ensure others understand it and we share the road to success along with challenges encountered on the way.
* We go to our manager for advice or guidance if we are unsure of our vision, unclear about expectations, or need help to resolve concerns.
* We are consistently and continuously giving feedback to our team members and no feedback at the annual review is a surprise. If one of our team members is surprised by their annual review, we haven’t done our job as managers.

*  I want to share a funny anecdote about “you are communicating well with your colleagues”. When we were planning to merge some teams in Bhala Dalvi’s org a while ago, Bhala kept pushing for us to move faster and I kept pushing back, insisting we needed conversations with the people affected for a successful re-org. Bhala’s reasoning was that Aman Bhutani (then President of BEXG) could do a re-org for all of BEXG in ~2 weeks after Tony Donohue (previous CTO) left. My counterargument was that Aman could do a re-org in 9 years. Aman hadn’t just been sitting around during his 9 years as CTO and President of BEXG, he had created all the relationships and trust necessary to be able to move fast when he needed to move fast. This is one reason why trust and communication as a leader are so important.

## Specifics to Working with Me
### 1:1s
* I want to support you. One of the ways for me to do this is to know your goals, aspirations, and generally what’s going on with you. If I know your aspirations, I can look out for opportunities for you and provide feedback to help you reach your goals.
* Our 1:1s should *not* be a status report, but a conversation. 
* This is also a forum for us to provide feedback to each other, brainstorm on how to improve our org, and generally make things better. 
* You can also use this time to complain. I am a good listener and will not judge you and will try to learn from your venting. If you are venting, I will assume you’re not asking for or expecting action and that’s fine. 
* If you want something fixed, I expect you to have at least one idea for a solution and we’ll work together to figure out next steps. If you are on my team, you are competent, and I believe you most often know the best next steps. 
* I will generally not have an agenda because I expect that our communication is continuous and we are regularly talking via slack, in person, or in email.  However, I’ll approach this 1:1 in the way that is easiest for you. For example, some people on my team like to track topics in a private slack channel or a shared document so that we don’t forget to visit specific topics, while others prefer a free-form conversation. Whatever works for you works for me. 

### Communication Preferences
* *Avoid surprises* with me or any stakeholder. I hate surprises, especially in mass communication, and I assume most people are like this. 
* *Feedback is a gift.* I firmly believe that we are all doing the best we can, so that if there’s room for improvement we likely need some feedback or we don’t see the improvement as a priority (and need feedback to inform our priorities).
* I am a strong believer in *being candid*. I don’t always understand or pick up on the nuances of individual speakers and I know from experience that making things rosy when delivering tough news doesn’t help. Being candid is not being hurtful or mean, it’s being honest and open and direct. I know that this requires a lot of trust on your part and I value your trust a great deal. I may act on feedback you’ve given, but I will do everything I can to make sure that everything you tell me in confidence remains between you and me (unless it’s illegal or something I have to report – please don’t do anything illegal).
* *Respect* is important. I expect and want open discussion (and often disagreement), always with respect. Respect means that we are actively attempting to communicate with a One Team perspective, and we are using appropriate language to promote accurate and effective understanding. This also means that we are proactively trying to learn about others and correcting our behavior as we learn more about what is appropriate to various audiences.
* *Transparency* is very important to me. My open calendar is one reflection of this belief. I will always answer questions as best I can and sometimes the answer may be, “I can’t comment on that”. You may receive too many emails from me because I want to make sure I’m sharing. Sorry about that.  Please feel free to copy me on emails or alert me to random stuff. Did I mention I hate surprises?  I want you to have autonomy, but it’s easiest to support you if you keep me in the loop. When in doubt, copy me on an email or forward an email thread to me or send me a summary.
* Assume *I am not available during non-business hours and I will do the same*. If I happen to send an email or a slack off-hours, I will assume you will respond at the soonest during the next business day. I confess that sometimes I’ll think of something on a Saturday and slack or send an email so I don’t forget, but unless I call you, it’s not urgent. I expect the same from you – call me or text me if it’s urgent.
* I have an unreliable memory and a lot going on. Because of this, *I rely heavily on email to track questions and outstanding actions, as well as decisions and context for decisions*. This will be hard for some of you and I will do my best to send emails summarizing slack or BlueJeans conversations when I believe it’s necessary, but I will need your help. Before asking you a question I will search my email to see if we’ve talked about a topic first to avoid asking you the same question more than once, though this is bound to happen. Thank you in advance for your patience. *I use Slack primarily for quick conversations or questions. BueJeans* is great when in person isn’t available and in person is preferred (e.g., for 1:1s or longer conversations). If an email thread is taking too much time, I prefer a meeting and a summary email with a context and any decisions we made.

## General
* I have a strong bias to action. Know that I like moving forward. Slow me down if it’s not appropriate. 
* You are on my team because you are capable (and many other things!). I will do all I can to support your growth and career opportunities. 
* I’m a big fan of work/life balance. Some people prefer work/life integration, but I need to shut off completely sometimes. I will do my best to respect your boundaries once I know them. 

## Inclusion and Diversity
Inclusion and diversity are extremely important to me, so I’ve included this as its own section. One of the reasons I became loyal to Expedia was their explicit stance on supporting diversity initiatives, their open support of all people, and their open condemnation of exclusive and hateful behavior. In addition, studies have shown that diversity yields higher productivity. It’s a win-win.
No one is here because they fill a quota. Every single person on this team is here because they are competent, including you. 
Two of my favorite quotes on including diversity on teams are included here:
> "Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome."
-Booker T. Washington

> “I objected anytime a student was dismissed for having a B on a transcript or for having gone to a less prestigious undergraduate program. If we were serious about bringing in minority lawyers, I asserted, we’d have to look more holistically at candidates. We’d need to think about how they’d used whatever opportunities life had afforded them rather than measuring them simply by how far they’d made it up an elitist academic ladder.”
-Michelle Obama in her book "Becoming"
